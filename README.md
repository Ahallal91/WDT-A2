## Projects Aim
The aim of this project was to create an Online Banking Application which allows customers to complete transactions such as Deposit,Withdraw and Transfer. Set up Bill Pays for other payments. View their transactions and edit them. The project also contains an Admin project which performs blocking of users/billpays and filters transactions and a WebAPI which is how the Admin project accesses the original database.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* ASP.NET core 5.0 Framework
* IdentityAPI
* C# back-end
* Razor Syntax for front-end
* Azure Cloud server back-end
* Cloud server populated via REST API calls.

## Launch
To launch the project you must have Visual Studio 2019 installed, Open the A2.sln file with Visual Studio.
From here you can select specific projects to launch. A2 will launch on its own whilst the Admin project needs the WebAPI running for it to be able to access data.
